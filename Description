My Final Project for the fundamentals of programming (15-112) will be a game “Cat Swing”. “Cat Swing” is a game where the player swings with a rope from platform to platform. Depending on the length of the rope and angle, the rope will swing with dependent velocity and trajectory. To make the game more interesting, other than swinging (space bar) player is allowed to jump and move right and left. If the space between different platforms is small enough, you can make the sprite jump from one to the other. The left-right-up-down keys are also used to overcome the different types of obstacles like moving and temporary platforms and “swing points”. On different levels, I will add different obstacles like spikes and moving objects that may kill the player. To make it look realistic, everything will respect most of the physics laws. I will include gravity, laws of the pendulum, Projectile motion for an object launched at an angle ( if the payer falls from the pendulum) and projectile motion for objects launched horizontally(if the player falls from the platform while running).
Regarding the visual interface: I plan to change the background and design different visual parts for the different levels. There also will be sound and visual effects (if payer dyes, wins or overcomes a hard obstacle). To implement all of these I’ll be using python and libraries such as Pygame Pymunck and Math.
For my first milestone, I will make the interface of the game and all the objects that will be used for the game. Namely, the platforms and the "swing points", the payer the background, but the game won't run.
For the second milestone, I will give the complete game as I described. It will all the features that aren’t in the first milestone. Meaning that I will make the player and objects move and interact with each other.
